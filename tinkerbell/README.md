## Overview

This chart brings up a full Tinkerbell stack on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.

These charts have been forked from the open source repo [github.com/tinkerbell/charts](https://github.com/tinkerbell/charts)
Summary of all the changes and contributions can be found [here](CHANGELOG.md)

The following components have been derived from the open source Tinkerbell stack:

- [Tink](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink)
- NGINX server
- [Smee](https://github.com/tinkerbell/smee)
- [Hegel](https://github.com/tinkerbell/hegel)
- [Hook](https://github.com/tinkerbell/hook)
- kube-vip Loadbalancer

out of which only the following are enabled by default at present

- Tink
- NGINX server (named Provisioning Artifacts Server)

A switch named `traefikReverseProxy` is provided which determines whether to use ingress and ingressroutes provided by
EMF external to these chart configurations, or use the local routing using `kube-vip`.

If `traefikReverseProxy` is disabled:

- Enable `kube-vip` to provide a service type loadBalancer IP for the Tinkerbell stack services
- `stack` acts as a server for handling proxying to the Tinkerbell service and for serving the Hook artifacts

If `traefikReverseProxy` is enabled:

- Traefik service running in `orch-gateway` namespace provides `IngressRoute` to `tink-server`
- NGINX based `Ingress` running in `orch-infra` namespace provides route to `tinkerbell`

### Why Smee is not required?

All the functionalities of Smee are being handled by the following components:

- DHCP server (assigns IP addresses):
  - Local DHCP server is expected to run in Edge Node network.
- TFTP/HTTP server [ Generate and serve ipxe.efi/auto.ipxe] :
  - ipxe.efi generated by [DKAM](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/infra-onboarding/tree/main/dkam)
  - auto.ipxe is replaced by static boot.ipxe
  - Above mentioned files are hosted in PA server.
- Syslog server [ Listen and store the the Tink Worker Logs] :
  - Handled by telemetry service running in EMF

### Why Hook is not required?

Hook OS image download and cryptographic signing is managed by [DKAM](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/infra-onboarding/tree/main/dkam)

### Why Hegel is not required?

Post booting to provisioned OS, cloud-init configuration is handled by [Onboarding Manager](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/infra-onboarding/tree/main/onboarding-manager)

## Get Started

### Bringing up the Edge Orchestrator

See the [the Edge Orchestrator documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-manageability-framework/blob/main/README.md) to learn more about setting up the Edge Orchestrator.

## Installing the Chart

If Tinkerbell charts are not deployed already in [Infra-Onboarding Chart](../infra-onboarding/Chart.yaml):

1. Fill in all the required fields in [values.yaml](values.yaml). Details about the fields can be found within the file.
2. Run the following set of commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/infra-charts
cd  infra-charts
helm dependency build tinkerbell/
helm install tinkerbell -f tinkerbell/values.yaml tinkerbell/ --create-namespace --namespace orch-infra --wait
```

These commands install the Tinkerbell Stack chart in the `orch-infra` namespace with the release name of `tinkerbell`.

## Validation steps

Copy the orch-CA certificate to your setup.

### For testing tink-stack

```bash
wget --no-proxy --ca-certificate=orch-ca.crt https://<nginxDnsname>/tink-stack/boot.ipxe
```

`nginxDnsname` is configured within [values.yaml](values.yaml).

### For testing tink-server

```bash
    apt update
    apt install curl
    apt install golang
    go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl@latest
    cd ~/go/bin
    ./grpcurl -cacert orch-ca.crt <tinkServerDnsname>:443 list
```

`tinkServerDnsname` is configured within [values.yaml](values.yaml).

## Installing the Chart with traefikReverseProxy disabled

Before installing the chart:

- Customize the IP used for the load balancer (`stack.loadBalancerIP`). This IP provides ingress for
Hegel, Tink, and Smee (TFTP, HTTP, and SYSLOG endpoints as well as unicast DHCP requests).

- If enabling smee, based on the services you want to use:
  - set the IP used in DHCP packets for option 54, the location of the iPXE binaries, the `auto.ipxe` script.
  - syslog IP, and the IP for downloading Hook files (`tinkerbell_smee.remoteIp`).
  The vast majority of the time,these 2 (`stack.loadBalancerIP` and `tinkerbell_smee.remoteIp`) IPs will be the same.

Now, deploy the chart.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/infra-charts
cd  infra-charts
helm dependency build tinkerbell/charts/tinkerbell
trusted_proxies=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.podCIDR}' | tr ' ' ',')
helm install tinkerbell tinkerbell/charts/tinkerbell --create-namespace --namespace orch-infra --wait --set "tinkerbell_smee.trustedProxies=${trusted_proxies}" --set "tinkerbell_hegel.trustedProxies=${trusted_proxies}"
```

These commands install the Tinkerbell Stack chart in the `orch-infra` namespace with the release name of `tinkerbell`.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `tinkerbell` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall tinkerbell --namespace tink-system
```
